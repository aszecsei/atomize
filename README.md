## What Is Atomize?

Atomize is an IRC client. Rather than using clients that were made a decade ago (and look it), Atomize lets you connect to existing IRC channels and servers with a sleek, modern interface inspired by other modern messaging applications.

In addition to general styling, Atomize also includes inline image displays and emoji! Because everything's better with emoji ðŸ˜„

## Getting Started

Simply download one of the releases and install the application!

## Build From Sources

If you prefer to build from sources, you can clone the repository. There are a few relevant `npm` scripts; to build, use `npm run dist`. To start a development build (which includes automatic reloading when code changes), use `npm run dev`.

## Testing

To run the test suite, run `npm test`. This will run our entire test suite and display any errors that might crop up.
